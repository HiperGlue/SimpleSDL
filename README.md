# SIMPLESDL: A BASIC 2D ENGINE

![SIMPLESDL BANNER](https://github.com/HiperGlue/HiperGlue/blob/main/SimpleSDL%20Banner.png)

## What is this?

This is a basic **2D game engine** developed with **C++ and SDL3**. It was made with the sole porpuse of learning more about the C++ language and to
avoid me the need of using a commercial one for my games.

This project focuses on avoiding OOP and complicated data structures while making the engine be based on a simple structure.

## How to use

This project is build using CMake and compiled as an static library.\
In order to add SIMPLESDL to your project move the library file (.lib/.a) and the include folder into it.\
When using the library just include the **main.hpp** file into your code.

## Goals

The main goals that I want to achieve with SIMPLESDL are:
+ First, to make an engine with a simple editor that gives the developer an easy control of every aspect.
+ Second, learn all about making this kind of software and then optimize everything I can on this.
